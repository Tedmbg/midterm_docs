> we need controll valves to regulate the amount of water being removed either by opening or closing them. solenod valves are 
commonly used.
> 🚧 we need a database to be able  to store soil mosture levels, crop water consumption rates, recomemnded irrigation
schedles. we should also store amount of water in the tank, amount of water that has been used at what intervals, rates
of evaporation type of the crop  number of water requirements.

>🗽 additionally an API will be used to be able to get real time weather  to make irrigation decisions or use the light sensor.or what type of sensor can i use.

> 🥁 communication modules .
- We need a website that the farmer can be able to see the amount of water used and the time irrigation took place.
- We can also send the farmer a message with the information.
- The farmer in the website should be able to see real time updates on soil mosture sensor,Weather conditions and adjust
irrigation settings remotely.
- We will connect with GSM (global system of mobile communications). to use data an later to use wifi.
 
>🥁 improvements and suggetions
-offer diffrent crop and  requirements.
-Offer crop nutrient sensor look at npk soil sensor.
- Soloar powered.
- Calculate the rate of evaporation.



>The web APP
- farmer will choose their crop type
-set irrigation schedules 
- monitor soil moisture levels.
- recieve notifications and alerts  about amount of water spent the amount of water remaining in the tank,send faults.
- send weather data i.e it raining etc..
- check the soil health.
- has a  small screen that the user will be able to input data and membrane keypad to write and read crops.
- When the user opens the system they will be able to see the date and age of the plants,and a welcome message for personalization.
- On start the sytem should try to establish connection form me i will use a sim card as a gsm.
- when teh user finished up teh setup the sytem will display nutrients in the soil,amount of water in the tank,
weather application,show data obtained from the sensors.
- the weather parameter wad obtained from the mobile application.
- Show the state of the valve.
- I want to collect the data of when the water was irrigate get the time to see a parttern.
- Be able to double check the values of the sensor by doing triple reads to compare the data.
- check if the plant will servive in the farm .i.e can i check soil types.
- in the future be able to detect the soil type to know the crops that can grow.
- track the rate of evaporation.
- check amount of water in the tank.
- open the solenoid valve and pass water.
- see when the plant pestosides need to be added to the crops.
- when entering the growth stages include initial,crop development,midseasonstage or late season stage.

# how power is transmitted
- the system has a total voltage of 10,000mAH. total voltage is 7.4 the 3.7 batteries are connected in series.
- formula for the relay module power(W) = Voltage(V) x Current(A)


---------- stucture of the DB ---------
- should have type of crops
- shuld have growth stages
- should have growth stages for diffrenc t crops
- amount water required for the plant
- evaporation rate at the farm.
- weather conditions at the farm
- amount of water in the tank  and the amount of water used  .
- time intervals in which the farm was irrigated. 
- data from the sensors.
- crop water requirement for each crop .
- cloud cover Relative humidity windspeed 

#### pins in the esp32
- VIN for voltage
- GND completing the circuit
- GPIO input output  pins  digital 
-ADC analog to digital

>>>>>>Essential nutrients for coffee
- Nitrogen (N):
    >Function: Nitrogen is essential for leaf and vegetative growth. 
     It supports the development of the plant's green parts, which are crucial for photosynthesis.
    > defeciency symptoms stunted growth,yellow leaves reduced yeild
-Phosphorus (p):
    >Function: Phosphorus is vital for root development and energy transfer in the plant,
     supporting strong root systems and enhancing flowering and fruit development.
    > Deficiency Symptoms: Poor root growth, delayed flowering, and reduced fruit size.
- K :
    > Function: Potassium is critical for regulating water uptake, 
     improving disease resistance, and enhancing fruit quality, including bean size and flavor.
    > Deficiency Symptoms: Marginal leaf burn, weak plants, poor fruit set, and uneven bean size.
