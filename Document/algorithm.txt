The controlled algorithm
-Kc is the crop coefficient  this represents the water needs of a specific crop.
- ET (evapotranspitation) actual amout of water the crop used
- look at diffrent kc value for coffee maiza and kales.
- Higher Cc values (larger plants with full canopies) mean more transpiration as plants release
 n water vapor through their leaves.

-  Importance in Irrigation:
> High relative humidity means the air is holding more water vapor, which reduces the evaporation of water from the soil and plants.

> Low relative humidity leads to higher evaporation rates because the air can hold more moisture, pulling water from the soil and plants faster.

-Kc (Crop Coefficient): Lookup value based on crop type and growth stage. You won't measure this with a sensor; instead, you'll use predefined tables.

-Cc (Canopy Cover): Generally observed visually or calculated based on crop growth stage.

-RH (Relative Humidity): Measure with a humidity sensor like DHT22 or SHT31.

-u (Wind Speed): Measure with an anemometer.

-ETo (Reference Evapotranspiration): Can be calculated using local weather data (temperature, humidity, wind speed, solar radiation), or you can get it from weather APIs.
