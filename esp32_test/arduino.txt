>>>>>>>>>>>>Hello Ted.
- the void setup is executed when the board loads up once and the loop will execute continuously as fast as possible
- 💊 we should use baud rate to increase and decrease the rate at which info is sent to board.
-In C++ we use the "" to display the string in print ln
When to Use Higher Baud Rates? 🚀
- Use higher baud rates like 921600 or 1152000 when you need to send a lot of data quickly (e.g., image or video data).
- For simple sensor data and debugging, 115200 is a good default.

- in c++ when defining a variable in switch case we need to put it in {} t

 --- the Buttons on the board🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆🏆
 - the EN button is the reset butn/enable this is for reseting the board. or starting the code again.
 - 100/boot  this shuold be presed if connecting has been their for to long.

THE ULTRASONIC SENSOR
- in the sensor we have vcc(Voltage common Collector) - this pin needs to be connected to stable power.
- Whenc onnecting the VCC from senor to VIN we are giving the sensor power. VIN provides 5V.
- By connecting GND of the sensor to GND of the ESP32, you are establishing a common ground, which allows both devices to “speak the same language” electrically.

- const byte ROWS = 4; // has 4 rows -- here we use byte instead of int beacuse byte uses less memory.

💯💯 the LCD is 16,2 
  lcd.setCursor(0,0); the first 0 is the column the other is the row.
  lcd.setCursor(8,0) ; this wil print from the center.

😱😱incase a depenency breaks here how we can fix it’s
>>>Add the below code in the terminal in the exact dir 
rm -rf .pio
rm -rf libdeps
platformio run --target clean
platformio run


-So, digital is binary (two choices), while analog offers a spectrum of possibilities!
- current is only measured in a circuit.
- current is the amout of stima inapita ,while voltage is the force that pushes the current.
-In series, you stack the tanks vertically. This increases the water pressure (voltage), but the total water (current capacity) remains the same.
-In parallel, you place the tanks side by side. The pressure (voltage) stays the same, but the combined water storage (current capacity) increases.

>>The energy capacity is given in ampere-hours (Ah):
  Capacity (Ah)
  =
  Current (A)
  ×
  Time (hours)
  Capacity (Ah)=Current (A)×Time (hours)


###🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼🐼 When using delay  the code stops  but when using millis() the code can be skipped
