>>>>>>>>> the HC-SR04 to the ESP32S Based on the Pinout Diagram
Let’s ensure you’re connecting the HC-SR04 sensor to the correct pins:

VCC (HC-SR04) → VIN (Pin 2) or 5V (Pin 38) on ESP32

This will power your sensor with a stable 5V supply.
GND (HC-SR04) → GND (Pin 1) on ESP32

Use any of the GND pins on the ESP32.
TRIG (HC-SR04) → GPIO13 (Pin 12) on ESP32

Ensure this is connected to the correct pin (based on the diagram, it’s Pin 12).
ECHO (HC-SR04) → GPIO12 (Pin 14) on ESP32

This should go to Pin 14 according to your diagram.

💪💪💪💪💪💪💪 the relay module
- i have connected the signal to come from pin 26.
- I have connected to the vcc to 5V and the ground to the GND

-The other side has NO(Normal open),COM(common) and NC(normal close).
